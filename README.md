☕ Cafe Management System – JAVA GUI

A Project by UKM Oxigen

Upgraded from CLI to GUI | Based on real café interviews in Bandung

📌 Project Overview

This is a Java GUI-based Cafe Management System developed by the UKM Oxigen team. The system is a continuation of a previous CLI-based project from Semester 1 (Algorithm and Programming I), now enhanced with an intuitive graphical interface and real-world functionalities based on interviews and feedback from café owners and staff in Bandung.

The system aims to support day-to-day operations of small to medium cafés by streamlining ordering, billing, menu management, and inventory tracking.

🎯 Objectives

Upgrade the CLI-based system into a full-featured Java GUI application.

Apply real user feedback to create a functional system for café operations.

Learn to collaborate using version control (GitHub) and real software development tools.

Combine front-end, back-end, and UX design efforts into one cohesive product.

🛠️ Technologies Used

💻 Java Swing – GUI development

🛠️ Apache NetBeans – IDE for Java development

🗃️ XAMPP (MySQL) – Database server and management

🗄️ SQL – Data persistence and query handling

🎨 FlatLaf – Modern Look & Feel library for Java Swing
